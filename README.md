# CNN-part-1

> We use TensorFlow + Keras to build models

We have 4 models Convolutional neural network (CNN) :

1. CNN (fashion_mnist dataset)
2. CNN (v01) (cats_and_dogs_small dataset)
3. CNN With data augmentation (v02) (cats_and_dogs_small dataset)
4. CNN With VGG-16 With data augmentation (v03) (cats_and_dogs_small dataset)

> we find them in `CNN.ipynb` and `Project.ipynb`
